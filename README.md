## How, Who and Why?
This project is using a MacOS machine that's located at a **different** country, it uses a Python script that was created by ***me*** to automate the procces

I created this project to eliminate the needing to go to any store to get your iPhone cellular working, and possibly lossing money

* That's it, just wait until it's done
